# [4.0.0 - TBA]

‚ö†Ô∏è **BREAKING CHANGE** ‚ö†Ô∏è: Combined 3 repositories (tests, core, docker) to one, called `framelix`. This make maintenance, further development and end-user usage a lot easier. The way you must setup your docker installation have changed. However, a working installation of v3.x can be upgraded with a bit of effort.


### üéØ Framelix core (backend/frontend) changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **BREAKING CHANGE** ‚ö†Ô∏è: All changes marked with ‚ö†Ô∏è are breaking changes. Database handling have also changed. The previous default DB `app` is not being generated and used anymore. Each module instance have it's own database, named by the module name by default. So `default` database connection also not exist anymore. To migrate, you must rename the `app` database to the module name of your instance.

* üõ†Ô∏è fixed minor layout glitch in small size mode
* üõ†Ô∏è fixed many tests and core code that failed because of now better error detection of new PhpUnit
* ‚úèÔ∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è renamed `Time` functions `timeStringToHours->toHours, timeStringToSeconds->toSeconds` and make conversion more lazy (accepting more types of values)
* ‚úèÔ∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è changed database handling so each module instance have it's own separate database, the default `app` database is being dropped
* ‚úèÔ∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è changed database handling to abstract SQL and make place for other types like mssql, sqlite, postgreesql
* ‚úèÔ∏è changed to hidden sidebar by default for some small views (Login, ForgotPassword, etc..)
* ‚úèÔ∏è changed internals of how app is set up (reduced checks, more streamlined, easier maintenance)
* ‚úèÔ∏è changed some vendor frontend libraries to package.json instead of manual installation
* ‚úèÔ∏è changed backend layout to be more flexible
* ‚ùå removed old unsupported setup vars
* ‚ùå removed `Config::$appSetupDone`, so you have to update your `01-core.php` config and remove it there manually
* Ô∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è upgraded PhpUnit to v10, PhpStan, Playwright, and various other integrated vendor libs
* Ô∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è upgraded several other frontend libraries (cashjs, sortablejs, popperjs, etc...)

### üê≥ Docker container changes

* ‚ûï added build ARG `OS_IMAGE` to be able to use another base ubuntu image (experimental). So you can install this also on a Raspberry PI for example, which have ARM architecture.
