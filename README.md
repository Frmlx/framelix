# Framelix - A dockerized Full-Stack PHP Framework

> We are currently setting up this repository for version 4. So it's not ready to use right now. Check back later.

Framelix is a full-stack PHP framework in a nicely packed, ready to go, docker environment. It's main focus is to
provide features for fast and agile development
of data management applications. It contains a full-featured responsive backend with a big set of features for your
daily business in data manegement development. Make your apps fast and reliable in no time.

## Docs/Playground

Doc pages are currently work in progress. Check back later.

## Main Features

* Dockerized - As framelix is required to run in a docker container, it is really secure by default. You don't have to think about the requirements to run the app. Database, Webserver, Code, it's all contained inside the container by default.
* Fast Development - Framelix is built to give you a tool to develop and deploy fast, really fast.
* Full-featured form generator - Data manegement requires forms very often. We focused on that from the beginning.
* Built-In JS/SCSS compiler/bundler - Write cutting edge SCSS/JS code, automatically compiled to browser standards.
* Model-View-Controller, kinda - MVC but simplified and reduced to what is really required. MVC often have a lot of boilerplate, not so in Framelix.
* Nearly 100% auto-completion support in your editor out of the box. We have some neat dev-tricks that you might not know yet.
* Advanced ORM Database Features - You work with `Storables`, which are basically objects that are stored in the
  database. You can write raw queries, but it's not required 99% of the time.
* Easy routing - We call our pages `Views`. A view is basically mapped to a URL. You can map a view to any URL you like.

## Development of your own application based on Framelix

Coming soon.

## Development in Framelix core itself

Coming soon.
